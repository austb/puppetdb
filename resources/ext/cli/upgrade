# Note: the variables here may look generic, but are currently
# exported by the puppet packaging scripts.  For example, even though
# they may look like it, JAVA_BIN and JAVA_ARGS are not upstream java
# variables (like JAVA_OPTS), but are set and exported by puppet.  And
# the USER variable here is not the bash variable of the same name,
# but is shadowing/clobbering it.  Most/all of these should be renamed
# to something less generic like PDB_CONFIG_FILE, or better yet (for
# that particular one), perhaps puppetdb should just support the
# variable itself.
